# Black Iris

A dark theme with pastel colors based on my previous work of the same name for Lapce, which is in itself based on blai30's Lotus theme for JetBrains IDE's.
The icon was made with the help of <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/iris" title="iris icons">Iris icons created by Icongeek26.</a>

I hope you enjoy it and kudos to blaia30 for bringing an awesome theme to life.
