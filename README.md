# Black Iris

A dark theme with pastel colors based on my previous work of the same name for Lapce, which is in itself based on blai30's Lotus theme for JetBrains IDE's.
The icon was made with the help of <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/iris" title="iris icons">Iris icons created by Icongeek26</a> and copius ammounts of effects from [PhotoDemon](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon).

You can install it for VSCode from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=p-yukusai.black-iris) and for VSCodium from [here](https://open-vsx.org/extension/p-yukusai/black-iris).

I hope you enjoy it and kudos to blaia30 for bringing an awesome theme to life.
